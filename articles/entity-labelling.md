# Entity Label LLM: Intelligent Financial Entity Extraction and Labeling

## Introduction

In the realm of financial data analysis, extracting and labeling entities from SMS messages presents a unique challenge. While traditional regex-based approaches can identify potential entities, determining their importance and proper labeling requires deeper contextual understanding. This article explores my project "Entity Label LLM," which combines the power of regex-based entity extraction with Claude-3.7's advanced language understanding capabilities to create a comprehensive financial entity labeling system.

## The Challenge of Financial Entity Labeling

Financial SMS messages contain various types of entities, but not all are equally important for user behavior analysis. The key challenges include:

1. **Entity Importance**: Determining which extracted entities are relevant for financial analysis
2. **Contextual Understanding**: Understanding the relationship between different entities in a message
3. **Label Consistency**: Maintaining consistent labeling across different message formats
4. **Noise Reduction**: Filtering out irrelevant or duplicate information
5. **Multi-Stage Processing**: Integrating outputs from multiple NLP pipelines

Traditional approaches often struggle with these challenges as they lack the contextual understanding needed to make intelligent decisions about entity importance and labeling.

## The Entity Label LLM Approach

My solution combines the strengths of regex-based extraction (from Auto-RegexIfy) with LLM-powered contextual understanding to create a comprehensive entity labeling system.

### System Architecture

The system works through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Initial Entity Extraction**
   - Using Auto-RegexIfy to extract potential entities
   - Standardizing entity formats
   - Preparing data for LLM processing

2. **SMS Categorization**
   - Leveraging the Multi-Category SMS Classification system
   - Determining message type and context
   - Providing additional context for entity labeling

3. **LLM Processing**
   - Feeding extracted entities and message context to Claude-3.7
   - Analyzing entity importance and relationships
   - Generating appropriate labels for important entities
   - Filtering out irrelevant entities

4. **Structured Output Generation**
   - Creating standardized JSON output
   - Maintaining entity relationships
   - Preserving original message context

### Technical Implementation

The implementation uses a combination of Python, FastAPI, and Claude-3.7:

```python
def process_sms_message(message: str) -> dict:
    '''
    Processes SMS message through the entity labeling pipeline
    '''
    # Step 1: Extract entities using Auto-RegexIfy
    extracted_entities = regex_preprocess_sms(message)
    
    # Step 2: Categorize message
    message_category = classify_sms(message)
    
    # Step 3: Prepare LLM prompt
    llm_prompt = prepare_llm_prompt(
        message=message,
        entities=extracted_entities,
        category=message_category
    )
    
    # Step 4: Get LLM response
    llm_response = get_claude_response(llm_prompt)
    
    # Step 5: Process and structure output
    structured_output = process_llm_response(llm_response)
    
    return structured_output

def prepare_llm_prompt(message: str, entities: dict, category: str) -> str:
    '''
    Prepares prompt for Claude-3.7
    '''
    prompt = f"""
    Message: {message}
    Category: {category}
    Extracted Entities: {json.dumps(entities, indent=2)}
    
    Please analyze the above information and:
    1. Identify which entities are important for financial analysis
    2. Provide appropriate labels for important entities
    3. Explain the relationship between entities
    4. Filter out irrelevant entities
    
    Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
    {
        "important_entities": [
            {
                "entity": "original_entity",
                "label": "appropriate_label",
                "importance_score": 0-1,
                "relationships": ["related_entity1", "related_entity2"]
            }
        ],
        "filtered_entities": ["irrelevant_entity1", "irrelevant_entity2"],
        "analysis_summary": "brief explanation of entity relationships"
    }
    """
    return prompt
```

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a real example of how the Entity Label LLM processes an SMS:

**Original SMS:**
```
Your FASTag for NL01G4829 is credited with Rs.500.00 on 22-02-2025 06:59:49 via Txn ID BD015053BAGAAAMPB3P8. Avl. Bal = Rs.1315.00. - IndusInd Bank
```

**Extracted Entities (from Auto-RegexIfy):**
```json
{
    "specificdate": "22-02-2025",
    "specifictime": "06:59:49",
    "generalentity": "nl01g4829",
    "generalprefixedamount": "500.00",
    "generalidnumber": "bd015053bagaaampb3p8",
    "generalprefixedbalance": "1315.00"
}
```

**LLM Processed Output:**
```json
{
    "important_entities": [
        {
            "entity": "nl01g4829",
            "label": "vehicle_registration",
            "importance_score": 0.9,
            "relationships": ["transaction_id", "amount"]
        },
        {
            "entity": "500.00",
            "label": "transaction_amount",
            "importance_score": 0.95,
            "relationships": ["vehicle_registration", "transaction_id"]
        },
        {
            "entity": "bd015053bagaaampb3p8",
            "label": "transaction_id",
            "importance_score": 0.8,
            "relationships": ["vehicle_registration", "transaction_amount"]
        }
    ],
    "filtered_entities": ["06:59:49"],
    "analysis_summary": "This is a FASTag recharge transaction for vehicle NL01G4829. The transaction amount of Rs.500.00 was credited successfully with transaction ID BD015053BAGAAAMPB3P8."
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

During development, several significant challenges emerged:

### Challenge 1: Entity Importance Scoring

Determining the importance of different entities proved challenging due to varying contexts.

**Solution**: Implemented a context-aware scoring system that considers:
- Message category
- Entity type
- Historical patterns
- Financial relevance

### Challenge 2: Label Consistency

Maintaining consistent labels across different message formats was difficult.

**Solution**: Created a standardized label taxonomy and implemented validation rules in the LLM prompt.

### Challenge 3: Processing Speed

The combination of multiple processing stages could impact performance.

**Solution**: Implemented caching for frequently seen message patterns and optimized the processing pipeline.

### Challenge 4: Error Handling

Handling edge cases and errors in the multi-stage pipeline required careful consideration.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms at each stage.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

The system's performance is significantly influenced by several key hyperparameters that were carefully tuned through experimentation:

1. **LLM Temperature (0.2)**
   - Controls the creativity vs. consistency of entity labeling
   - Lower value (0.2) ensures consistent labeling across similar messages
   - Higher values tested (0.5-0.8) led to inconsistent labeling

2. **Entity Importance Threshold (0.7)**
   - Minimum score required for an entity to be considered important
   - Values below 0.7 included too many irrelevant entities
   - Values above 0.8 filtered out some important contextual entities

3. **Context Window Size (3)**
   - Number of previous messages considered for context
   - Window size of 3 provided optimal balance between context and performance
   - Larger windows (5+) showed diminishing returns with increased processing time

4. **Cache Size (1000)**
   - Number of message patterns stored in memory
   - 1000 patterns covered 95% of common message types
   - Larger cache sizes showed minimal improvement in hit rates

5. **Batch Size (32)**
   - Number of messages processed in parallel
   - 32 messages provided optimal throughput
   - Larger batches (64+) led to increased memory usage without significant speedup

The final hyperparameter values were determined through grid search and cross-validation on a diverse dataset of 10,000 financial SMS messages.

## Future Directions

The Entity Label LLM project opens several avenues for future work:

1. **Enhanced Context Understanding**: Improving the LLM's understanding of financial context
2. **Real-time Processing**: Optimizing for real-time financial analysis
3. **Multi-language Support**: Extending support for more languages and scripts
4. **Custom Labeling Rules**: Allowing users to define custom labeling rules
5. **Integration with Financial APIs**: Connecting with banking APIs for enhanced analysis

## Conclusion

The Entity Label LLM system demonstrates the power of combining traditional NLP techniques with modern LLM capabilities for intelligent entity extraction and labeling. By leveraging the strengths of both regex-based extraction and contextual understanding, the system achieves excellent performance in processing financial SMS messages.

This approach not only improves entity extraction accuracy but also enables more nuanced analysis of financial data, unlocking valuable insights for businesses and enhancing the user experience through more intelligent message handling and organization.
