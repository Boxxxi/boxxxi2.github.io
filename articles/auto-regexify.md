# Auto-RegexIfy: Standardizing SMS with Enhanced Regex Patterns

## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data is a critical challenge. SMS messages, in particular, present unique difficulties due to their informal nature, abbreviations, and inconsistent formatting. This article explores my project "Auto-RegexIfy," an advanced regex-based pipeline that standardizes unstructured text data and generates optimized regex patterns for entity extraction.

## The Challenge of SMS Standardization

SMS messages often contain valuable information such as transaction details, appointment confirmations, or authentication codes. However, extracting this information consistently presents several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Different senders use different formats for the same type of information
2. **Abbreviations and Shorthand**: Common in SMS to save character space
3. **Multilingual Content**: Messages may contain multiple languages or scripts
4. **Noise and Irrelevant Information**: Promotional content mixed with important details

Traditional approaches to this problem often involve manually crafting regex patterns for each type of message, which is time-consuming and doesn't scale well as new message formats emerge.

## The Auto-RegexIfy Approach

My solution, Auto-RegexIfy, takes a systematic approach to SMS standardization and entity extraction by leveraging the power of regex pattern matching in a multi-stage process.

### System Architecture

The system works through a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Preprocessing and Normalization**
   - Text cleaning (lowercasing, stripping whitespace)
   - Basic normalization (standardizing formats)
   - Preparing text for pattern matching

2. **Standardization with Keyword Replacement**
   - Using a dictionary of common patterns to replace variations with standardized keywords
   - Converting specific entities (dates, times, amounts) to standardized formats
   - Replacing entity variations with generalized placeholders

3. **Pattern Generation**
   - Generating regex patterns based on the standardized structure
   - Replacing standardized keywords with capturing regex patterns
   - Optimizing patterns for accuracy and performance

4. **Entity Extraction**
   - Applying optimized patterns to extract structured data
   - Validating and formatting extracted entities
   - Labeling entities based on their context

### Technical Implementation

The implementation uses Python's regex library with a three-dictionary approach:

```python
def regex_preprocess_sms(text: str) -> dict:
    '''
    Applies regex preprocess on sms text
    '''
    # Clean and normalize text
    text = text.lower().strip()
    response = {}

    # Apply replacement patterns
    for word in REGEX_MAP:
        text, replace_word = replace_entities(text, word)
        if replace_word:
            response.update({f'replaced_{word}': replace_word})

    # Apply extraction patterns
    for word in REGEX_MAP_COMBINED:
        text, entities = extract_entities(text, word)
        for key, value in entities:
            response.update({f'extracted_{key}': value})

    response.update({'cleaned_text': text})
    return response

def generate_auto_regex(text: str) -> str:
    '''
    Generates auto regex from cleaned text
    '''
    # Start auto-regex with ignore-case and space handling
    auto_regex = r"(?s)(?i)"

    # Generating auto-regex by word
    for part in text.split(" "):
        if part:
            if part in REGEX_MAP:
                # Replace keywords by corresponding replacement patterns
                auto_regex += SPACE_REGEX + f"(?:{REGEX_MAP[part]})"

            elif part in REGEX_MAP_COMBINED:
                # Replace keywords by corresponding capturing patterns
                replace_regex = ENTITY_REGEX_REPLACE_MAP.get(
                    part,
                    REGEX_MAP_COMBINED[part]
                )
                auto_regex += SPACE_REGEX + replace_regex

            else:
                for char in SPECIAL_CHARACTERS:
                    # Handle special characters
                    part = part.replace(char, f"\\{char}")

                # Add the rest as it is
                auto_regex += SPACE_REGEX + part

    # End auto-regex with end-of-line handling
    auto_regex += SPACE_REGEX + "$"
    return auto_regex
```

The key to this approach is the three dictionaries that work together:

1. `REGEX_MAP`: Maps variations of terms to standardized keywords for replacement
   ```python
   REGEX_MAP = {
       'transfer': r"transferring|transferred|transfer|trans\b|trf",
       'insufficient': r"insufficient|insufficien|insuf|insf",
       'balance': r"balances|balance|currbal\b|bal\b|\bbl\b|\btotbal\b|\bacbal\b|\bbalrs\b|शेष\s*राशि",
       'available': r"available|avlbl\b|avlbl|avbl|avail\b|aval\b|\baval\b|avl\b|avb\b",
       'amount': r"\bamount|amnt\b|amt\b|राशि",
       # ... many more patterns
   }
   ```

2. `REGEX_MAP_COMBINED`: Contains phrase-based regex patterns for entity extraction
   ```python
   REGEX_MAP_COMBINED = {
       'generalupiid': r"(?:vpa|upi)(?:\W*)?(?:id|number)?(?:\W*)?(\d+\w*)",
       'upiid': r"((?:[-a-z\d_]+)(?:(?:[\.])(?:[-a-z\d_]+))*@(?:[a-z]+))",
       'specificpan': r"(\d*[xx\*]+\s*\-*\d+\-*[xx\*]*)",
       'generalnumber': r"(?:\bnumber)?(?:\W*)?([\d,\.]*\d+)",
       # ... many more patterns
   }
   ```

3. `ENTITY_REGEX_REPLACE_MAP`: Maps standardized keywords to specific regex capturing patterns
   ```python
   ENTITY_REGEX_REPLACE_MAP = {
       'generalupiid': r'(\d+\w*)',
       'generalnumber': r"([\d,\.]*\d+)",
       # ... many more patterns
   }
   ```

## Real-World Example

Let's look at a real example of how Auto-RegexIfy processes an SMS:

**Original SMS:**
```
Your FASTag for NL01G4829 is credited with Rs.500.00 on 22-02-2025 06:59:49 via Txn ID BD015053BAGAAAMPB3P8. Avl. Bal = Rs.1315.00. - IndusInd Bank
```

**Standardized SMS:**
```
your fastag for generalentity is credit with rupees.generalprefixedamount on specificdate specifictime via transaction id generalidnumber. available.balance = rupees.generalprefixedbalance - indusind bank
```

**Generated Regex Pattern:**
This pattern would be generated based on the standardized SMS, with each standardized keyword replaced by its corresponding regex capture pattern. The actual pattern would be specific to this type of message and would capture the entities shown below.

**Captured Entities:**
```
specificdate: 22-02-2025
specifictime: 06:59:49
generalentity: nl01g4829
generalprefixedamount: 500.00
generalidnumber: bd015053bagaaampb3p8
generalprefixedbalance: 1315.00
```

This pattern can now be used to extract structured information from similar SMS messages, even if they have slight variations in formatting or wording.

## Results and Performance

The Auto-RegexIfy system achieved impressive results:

- **99.4% resolution rate** on data previously extracted by traditional methods
- **97% resolution rate** on previously unextracted data
- **91% accuracy** in entity extraction across diverse SMS formats
- **80% reduction** in the time required to develop new extraction patterns
- **75% improvement** in handling edge cases and variations
- Successfully processed messages in multiple languages and scripts

### Deduplication Benefits

A key advantage of the Auto-RegexIfy approach is the significant reduction in the number of regex patterns needed in production:

- Standardizing SMS messages before pattern generation allows for effective deduplication
- Analysis showed that only **13% of the data was non-duplicate** after standardization
- This translates to a much smaller set of regex patterns needed in production compared to traditional approaches
- Fewer patterns means lower computational overhead and easier maintenance

### Case Study: Transaction SMS

One particularly successful application was in standardizing transaction SMS messages from different banks and payment providers. The system was able to:

1. Identify common patterns across different financial institutions
2. Extract critical information like amount, merchant, date, and reference number
3. Handle variations in currency formats, date representations, and merchant naming

## Challenges and Solutions

During development, several significant challenges emerged:

### Challenge 1: Pattern Ordering and Processing Sequence

The order of regex patterns for processing proved to be critical for accurate entity extraction.

**Solution**: Carefully arranged patterns in a specific sequence to prevent miscapturing and ensure higher resolution rates. This required extensive testing and refinement to determine the optimal order.

### Challenge 2: Special Character Handling

The usage of special characters, especially word boundary markers like `\b`, significantly impacted accuracy.

**Solution**: Implemented precise usage of word boundaries and other special regex characters to improve entity capture accuracy while reducing pattern length and memory usage.

### Challenge 3: Dictionary Architecture Evolution

Initial attempts with a single dictionary for both standardization and regex generation yielded poor results.

**Solution**: Evolved to a three-dictionary architecture:
1. First dictionary (`REGEX_MAP`) for standardizing variations of terms
2. Second dictionary (`REGEX_MAP_COMBINED`) for phrase-based entity capturing
3. Third dictionary (`ENTITY_REGEX_REPLACE_MAP`) for specific entity extraction patterns

This multi-dictionary approach was crucial in achieving the 99.4% resolution rate.

### Challenge 4: Entity Labeling

Initially faced difficulties in properly labeling captured entities.

**Solution**: Implemented phrase-based capturing which eliminated most labeling issues by providing context for the extracted entities.

### Challenge 5: Capturing Alphabetical Entities

Capturing purely alphabetical entities like merchant names remains challenging due to their highly variable context.

**Current Approach**: Using preceding and succeeding phrases where possible, but these are often inconsistent.

**Future Solution**: Considering integration of LLMs or sequence classification methods to better identify and label alphabetical entities.

## Future Directions

The Auto-RegexIfy project opens several avenues for future work:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Using ML to automatically identify new patterns and suggest additions to the standardization dictionary
2. **Cross-Domain Application**: Extending the approach to other text standardization problems beyond SMS
3. **Interactive Pattern Builder**: Creating a user interface for non-technical users to define and refine extraction patterns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Improving the efficiency of pattern matching for real-time applications
5. **Alphabetical Entity Extraction**: Developing specialized techniques for capturing merchant names and other purely alphabetical entities

## Conclusion

Auto-RegexIfy demonstrates the power of a systematic, multi-dictionary approach to text standardization and entity extraction. By leveraging the strengths of regex patterns with a carefully designed process of standardization followed by pattern generation, the system achieves excellent performance in processing SMS messages.

This approach represents a practical, efficient solution for text processing systems that need to handle diverse, unstructured text data without the computational overhead of more complex AI models.
